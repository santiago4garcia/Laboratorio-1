You can perform slicing using both the index and the name of the column.\n","\n","> NOTE: When slicing in pandas, the start bound is included in the output.\n","\n","So if you want to select rows 0, 1, and 2 your code would look like this: df.iloc\\[0:3].\n","\n","It means you are telling Python to start at index 0 and select rows 0, 1, 2 up to but not including 3.\n","\n","> NOTE: Labels must be found in the DataFrame or you will get a KeyError.\n","\n","Indexing by labels(i.e. using <code>loc()</code>) differs from indexing by integers (i.e. using <code>iloc()</code>). With <code>loc()</code>, both the start bound and the stop bound are inclusive. When using <code>loc()</code>, integers can be used, but the integers refer to the index label and not the position.\n","\n","For example, using <code>loc()</code> and select 1:4 will get a different result than using <code>iloc()</code> to select rows 1:4.\n","\n","<h4 id=\"data\">We can also select a specific data value using a row and column location within the DataFrame and iloc indexing.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Noky6xHmVczx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# let us do the slicing using old dataframe df\n","\n","df.iloc[0:2, 0:3]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":112},"id":"Zu-IAFBqVczy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677428624193,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":298,"user":{"displayName":"SANTIAGO GARCIA LOPEZ","userId":"16585413098639088258"}},"outputId":"1d1dce68-3b27-436e-be54-2064fc425823"},"execution_count":62,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Name  ID       Department\n","0  Rose   1  Architect Group\n","1  John   2   Software Group"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-d3ab3eee-53aa-4e94-8546-7bee9eb27011\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>ID</th>\n","      <th>Department</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Rose</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Architect Group</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>John</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>Software Group</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-d3ab3eee-53aa-4e94-8546-7bee9eb27011')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-d3ab3eee-53aa-4e94-8546-7bee9eb27011 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
