There are many different types of objects in Python. Let's start with the most common object types: <i>strings</i>, <i>integers</i> and <i>floats</i>. Anytime you write words (text) in Python, you're using <i>character strings</i> (strings for short). The most common numbers, on the other hand, are <i>integers</i> (e.g. -1, 0, 100) and <i>floats</i>, which represent real numbers (e.g. 3.14, -42.0).</p>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pWibUp8xyqNC"},"source":["<a align=\"center\">\n","    <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%201/images/TypesObjects.png\" width=\"600\">\n","</a>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ast2d2puyqNC"},"source":["<p>The following code cells contain some examples.</p>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_FRQWvkLyqND","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677080717130,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":240,"user":{"displayName":"SANTIAGO GARCIA LOPEZ","userId":"16585413098639088258"}},"outputId":"496c1f32-30de-430c-c844-8dfbd30c76cf"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["11"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["# Integer\n","\n","11"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YdUkpFyEyqND"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Float\n","\n","2.14"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"papn0SLAyqNE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677080724245,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":266,"user":{"displayName":"SANTIAGO GARCIA LOPEZ","userId":"16585413098639088258"}},"outputId":"76efc4d0-6e29-4400-a2e3-081c8c801d2d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Hello, Python 101!'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"source":["# String\n","\n","\"Hello, Python 101!\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nf0yn5GjyqNG"},"source":["<p>You can get Python to tell you the type of an expression by using the built-in <code>type()</code> function.
